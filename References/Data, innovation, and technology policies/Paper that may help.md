## ****** Data-Driven Policy Making: The Policy Lab Approach

By Anne Fleur van Veenstra & Bas Kotterink 

### Intro

Data-driven policy making uses ICTs to capture the benefits of new data sources and builds on the notion of evidence-based policy making.

Data-driven policy is mainly concerned with the **inclusion of big and open data sources into policy making** as well as with **co-creation of policy by involving citizens**.
Data-driven policy making aims to use new data sources such as (real-time) sensor data and new techniques for processing these data and to realize co-creation of policies, involving citizens and other relevant stakeholders. 

+ Capturing data: sensor data, open data, and social media data
+ Integrating data: Cross-organizational collaboration, linking new data sources to traditional statistics for Sentiment analysis, location mapping, advanced social network analysis
+ Application of data: Real-time monitoring of policy,transparency and accountability, for Visualization techniques, computer simulation

To allow for better collaboration and involve citizens, public administrations around the world have set up Policy Labs to allow for experimentation and facilitate the involvement of relevant stakeholders

### The Policy Lab Approach

**Policy lab:** A Policy Lab is an experimental environment in which stakeholders collaborate to develop and test policy. 

In this paper we develop a Policy Lab approach for data-driven policy making.

[所以大概就是按着phases of policy cycle塞入data及可能的方法 也就是给未来的政策决策提供一种可能性]
